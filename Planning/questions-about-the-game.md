SUBJECT: Bazaar Game Questions <br>

**Questions** <br>
- How many stars will there be per game?
- How do we ensure that the game does not run indefinitely? (i.e. additional methods or checks to prevent infinite loops)
- How should we manage pebble exchanges, and specifically, what should we do if we run out of pebbles in the bank?
